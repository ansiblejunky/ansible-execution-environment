# Ansible Execution Environment Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Ansible Execution Environment (EE) builder project.

Why this documentation: to give new and advanced users actionable, task-focused guides and the background needed to make sound design decisions with EEs.

## What is an Execution Environment?

In modern automation, a common challenge is ensuring that your Ansible Playbooks run reliably everywhere. An automation might work on your laptop but fail in a CI/CD pipeline because of a different version of Python, a missing library, or an incompatible Ansible Collection.

An **Execution Environment** solves this problem. It is a self-contained container image that packages everything your automation needs to run:

-   A specific version of Ansible
-   Specific versions of Python packages
-   Required Ansible Collections
-   Any necessary system-level libraries or tools

By running your playbooks inside an EE, you guarantee a consistent, predictable, and portable environment for your automation, no matter where it runs.

## Why Use This Project?

While you can build Execution Environments from scratch, this repository provides a framework to make the process standardized, repeatable, and easy to customize.

-   **For New Users:** It provides a "batteries-included" starting point. You can simply edit a few text files to define your dependencies, run `make build`, and get a working EE without needing to be an expert in containerization.
-   **For Advanced Users:** It offers a flexible and powerful way to manage the entire lifecycle of your EEs. The `Makefile` provides hooks to clean, build, test, inspect, and publish your images, and the configuration files offer deep customization options.

This documentation will guide you through understanding, using, and extending this framework.

## ⚡ Quick Reference for New Users

**First Steps:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make setup` to verify your environment
3. Set `ANSIBLE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable (for certified collections)
4. Run `make build` to create your execution environment
5. Run `make test` to verify it works

**Key Insights:**
- ✅ `make setup` - Verify environment before building (catches issues early)
- ✅ Python 3.10+ required - Python 3.11 recommended on RHEL 9
- ✅ `python3-pip` must be in `bindep.txt` - Minimal images don't include pip by default
- ✅ Token only needed for `build`/`token` - `test`/`setup`/`lint` work without token
- ✅ Use `--pull-policy never` - Ensures local images are used for testing
- ✅ Minimal images are minimal - Use `test -f` instead of `which` command

**Common Issues:**
- "No module named pip" → Add `python3-pip [platform:rpm]` to `files/bindep.txt`
- Token errors on test → Token check now only runs when needed
- Image pull errors → Test target uses `--pull-policy never`
- Missing `which` command → Use `test -f /path/to/binary` instead
