# [ADR-0001] Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As we develop and maintain this Ansible Execution Environment, we need a way to:
- Track important architectural decisions
- Understand the context and reasoning behind past decisions
- Provide a historical record for future maintainers
- Ensure consistent decision-making processes across the team

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in the project. Each ADR will:
- Be stored in the `docs/adrs` directory
- Follow the template in `0000-adr-template.md`
- Be numbered sequentially (XXXX format)
- Be written in Markdown format
- Include status, context, decision, consequences, and alternatives considered

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Historical context preserved for future team members
- Consistent decision-making process
- Easy to reference and link to specific decisions
- Markdown format ensures easy reading and editing

### Negative
- Additional overhead in documenting decisions
- Need to maintain ADR documentation
- Potential for documentation to become outdated if not properly maintained

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Wiki Pages**
   - Less structured
   - More difficult to version control
   - Harder to review changes

2. **Informal Documentation**
   - No consistent format
   - Risk of missing important context
   - Harder to track decision history

3. **Issue Tracker**
   - Mixed with day-to-day tasks
   - Harder to find historical decisions
   - Less structured format
